# Final Project Proposal

1. I plan to use the QUIC model developed by Kenneth L. McMillan and Lenore D. Zuck with the paper "*Formal specification and testing of QUIC*".
Using the model located in the [Microsoft Ivy GitHub repository for QUIC](https://github.com/microsoft/ivy/tree/master/doc/examples/quic), I will analyze the given model and locate a weakness that could be exploited in the security/verification. Using that weakness I will insert a test case that exploits it and causes an additional failure.

2. I will be using ivy to attack the QUIC model

3. Timeline
    + Dec 2: Finish analyzing the given QUIC model
    + Dec 9: Finish reviewing the given test files
    + Dec 16: Finalize the attack test file
