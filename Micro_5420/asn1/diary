Problem 8
===========
</strong>

A piece of intrinsic silicon carries an electron drift current
density of Jn=1 uA/cm^2. If the mobility of electrons is
mu_n= 1.5 k cm^2/V*s, calculate the electric field
strength in the material. Give your answer in V/cm.

Given information (available in the workspace):

* mu_n= 1.5 k cm^2/V*s 
* ni= 1.5e+10 electrons per cm^3 
* q= 1.6e-19 Coulombs per electron
