14. What is the minimum and maximum Ethernet payload (in bytes)?
    Minimum = _________
    Maximum = _________ 

15. In which of the following scenarios is an entry made to the ARP cache? (Circle all that apply)

a) An ARP request arrives that asks for this computer’s MAC address - **Yes**

b) An ARP request arrives that asks for another computer’s MAC address - **Yes**

d) An IP frame arrives from a computer on the same subnet as this computer - **No**

16. What is time-division multiplexing?

**Time-division multiplexing is when systems are given times that they can talk on the network. It can be combined into larger and larger packets.**

Physical Layer ______ c. user programs are part of this layer 
Transport Layer ______ d. handles framing of data
Presentation Layer ______ e. deals with voltages, frequencies, radiation, etc.
